<dl>
<dt><i>There is Nothing Left to Lose</i></dt>
<dd>This album released at the end of 1999, and it is frequently ranked as one of the most popular Foo Fighter's albums of all time. I was only a child when this album was released, but my older brother would blast this album on repeat throughout the house. Three songs from this album-- "Learn to Fly", "Aurora", and "Headwires"-- rank amongst my favorite songs of all time. This album is perfect for long drives with its great melodies, deep lyrics, and a strong soft rock feel. </dd>

<dt><i>The Colour and the Shape</i></dt>
<dd>I rank this album as my second favorite album from the Foo Fighters primarily due to the inclusion of the song, "Everlong", which is both my favorite Foo Fighters song as well as my favorite song of all time. This was the first Foo Fighters song I heard as a child due to my older brother's growing love for the band. The album varies from a softer grunge rock to a heavier hard rock, so it speaks to individuals across genres. Following the release of the Foo Fighter's first album in 1995, Dave Grohl was instructed to make his lyrics more meaningful in his Sophomore album. This is reflected throughout <i>The Colour and Shape</i>, where Dave Grohl sings about life, freedom, and a failing marriage. </dd>

<dt><i>In Your Honor</i></dt>
<dd>Ranking third amongst my favorite all time Foo Fighter's albums is <i>In Your Honor</i>. This album released in 2005 while I was in middle school. The songs in this album have a much stronger rock feel, with heavier guitar, louder lyrics, and a different overall "vibe". A prime example of this comes from the song, "Best of You", which sits as song three on the album. As a teen, the louder style played towards my angst, but as an adult, I can appreciate the meaningful lyrics and differing musical styles throughout </dd>
